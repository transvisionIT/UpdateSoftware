<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family= ariel;"> Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details. These attacks are typically carried out through deceptive emails, websites, or other digital communication that appears to be from a legitimate source.</p>
</div>
<h><b><span style="color: orange"; font-size:24px;>How To Spot Phishing</b></h>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: blue;">1.Suspicious Email Address:</p></b></h>
<li> If you were receiving an email from LinkedIn, you would expect it to come from a linkedin.com domain not linkedin@gmail.com. Always check the “reply to” email to find spoofed senders.</li>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: green;">2.Suspicious Link in the Email/SMS:</p></b></h>
<li>You can determine the legitimacy of the link by hovering over it before clicking. When analyzing the URL, check to make sure it starts with an https:// not http://.  You can also check the site's certificate to see who it’s issued to. A fraudulent link usually looks like XYZ</li>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: purple;">3.Grammetical Errors:</p></b></h>
<li>Always check for grammatical errors, not just spelling mistakes.</li>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: brown;">4.Unnecessarily Urgent:</p></b></h>
<li>Phishers love to ask you to do something right now or else. Whether that is clicking on a link or replying to an email, they want you to act ASAP. They do this to try to scare or threaten you, such as closing down an account or confirming activity.</li>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: orange;">5.Generic Greetings:</p></b></h>
<li>The email may start with Dear Sir or Madam or Dear User, which isn’t how people normally talk to each other when writing emails. It usually isn’t personalized unless it’s spear phishing.</li>
<h><b><p style="font-size:18px; color: Red;">6. Offers that are too Good to be True:</p></b></h>
<li>That’s because they are! Don’t respond or click on any links in these emails.</li>
<h><b><span style="color:blue"; font-size:24px;">PHISHING SAFTY TIPS</b></span></h>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: green;">1. Recognize Suspicious Emails and Messages</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b> Check the sender's email address:</b> Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but may have slight misspellings (e.g., "am@azon.com" instead of "amazon.com").</li>
<li><b> Be wary of urgent language:</b> Phishing emails often use threats or urgency, such as "Your account will be locked!" or "Immediate action required!"</li>
<li> <b>Look for grammar mistakes:</b> Many phishing messages contain spelling errors or awkward phrasing.</li>
<li><b> Don’t trust unexpected attachments or links:</b> If you're not expecting an email with an attachment or link, be cautious. Hover over links to see if the URL is legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: blue;">2. Don't Click Suspicious Link</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b>Contact the source directly:</b> If you receive an unexpected email asking for personal information or action (such as changing a password), verify the request by contacting the organization directly using official contact methods, such as their website or customer service number.</li>
<li><b>Look for authentication signs:</b>  Genuine websites often use secure connections (look for HTTPS and a padlock symbol in the browser’s address bar).</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: brown;">3. Verify Before Acting</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b>Hover before clicking:</b> Hovering over a link with your mouse will show you the actual URL. If the URL looks suspicious or doesn’t match the source, don’t click it.</li>
<li><b>Shortened links:</b> Phishers often use URL shortening services to disguise malicious links. If you’re unsure about a shortened URL, don’t click on it.</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: brown;">4. Use Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b>Enable MFA on accounts:</b> Even if a hacker obtains your password through phishing, MFA adds an additional layer of protection, requiring a second verification step (like a code sent to your phone).</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: Purple;">5. Protect Personal Information</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b>Be cautious about sharing personal details:</b> Never share sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or bank account details, over email, social media, or unsecured websites.</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: indigo;">6. Educate Yourself and Others</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li><b>Stay informed about phishing tactics:</b> Phishing tactics evolve, so it's important to stay updated on new phishing techniques and trends.</li>
<li><b>Share knowledge:</b> Educate family members, coworkers, and others in your network about how to recognize phishing attempts and what to do when they encounter them.</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: indigo;">7. Check for Phishing Scams on Social Media</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious if someone contacts you unexpectedly through social media, asking for personal information or encouraging you to click a suspicious link.</li>
<li><b>Verify profiles:</b> Phishers often create fake social media profiles that look like those of legitimate businesses, so always double-check the authenticity of the account.</li>
</ul>
<h><b><p style="font-size: 18px; color: indigo;">8. Report Phishing</p></b></h>
<ul>
<li>If you encounter a phishing attempt, report it to your email provider or the organization being impersonated. Many companies have dedicated channels for reporting phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>
<li><p style="text-align: center; font-size=28px; color: red"><b>********If you suspect deceit, hit delete!********</b></p></li>
